            <ul>
                <li>Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.</li>
                <li>The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.</li>
                <li>Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.</li>
                <li>The more we value things, the less we value ourselves.</li>
                <li>If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done. Make at least one definite move daily toward your goal.</li>
                <li>If you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life. 
                    It’ll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. 
                    A man must constantly exceed his level.</li>
                <li>Be happy, but never satisfied.</li>
                <li>Preparation for tomorrow is hard work today.</li>
                <li>The spirit of the individual is determined by his dominating thought habits</li>
                <li>To spend time is to pass it in a specified manner. To waste time is to expend it thoughtlessly or carelessly. We all have time to either spend or waste and it is our decision what to do with it. 
                    But once passed, it is gone forever.</li>
                <li>The meaning of life is that it is to be lived, and it is not to be traded and conceptualized and squeezed into a pattern of systems.</li>
                <li>It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.</li>
                <li>Do not allow negative thoughts to enter your mind for they are the weeds that strangle confidence.</li>
                <li>Mistakes are always forgivable if one has the courage to admit them.</li>
                <li>Those who are unaware they are walking in darkness will never seek the light</li>
                <li>Don’t fear failure. Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts, it is glorious even to fail.</li>
                <li>Defeat is a state of mind; No one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality.</li>
            </ul>
